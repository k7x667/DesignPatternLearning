# Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They represent best practices for solving certain types of problems and provide a way to create more maintainable and flexible software systems. Here, we discuss some commonly used Creational and Structural Design Patterns.

## Creational Design Patterns

### Factory Method Pattern
- [Factory Method Pattern](/ressource/creational/factoryMethod/index.md) 
  - [EXO1TS](/exo/creational/factoryMethod/1/index.ts)
  - [EXO2TS](/exo/creational/factoryMethod/2/index.ts)

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating instances of a class.

### Abstract Factory Pattern
- [Abstract Factory Pattern](/ressource/creational/abstractFactory/index.md)
  - [EXO1TS](/exo/creational/abstractFactory/1/index.ts)
  - [EXO2TS](/exo/creational/abstractFactory/2/index.ts)
  - [BONUS](/exo/creational/abstractFactory/2/bonus.ts)

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Builder Pattern
- [Builder Pattern](/ressource/creational/builder/index.md)
  - [EXO1TS](/exo/creational/builder/index.ts)

The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Singleton Pattern
- [Singleton Pattern](/ressource/creational/singleton/index.md)
  - [EXO](/exo/creational/singleton/index.ts)

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Structural Design Patterns

### Adapter Pattern
- [Adapter Pattern](/ressource/structural/adapter/index.md)
  - [EXO1TS](/exo/structural/adapter/1/index.ts)
  - [EXO2TS](/exo/structural/adapter/2/index.ts)

The Adapter Pattern allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface, making it compatible with the client's expectations.

### Facade Pattern
- [Facade Pattern](/ressource/structural/facade/index.md)
  - [EXO](/exo/structural/facade/index.ts)

The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use and reducing dependencies.

### Decorator Pattern
- [Decorator Pattern](/ressource/structural/decorator/index.md)
  - [EXO1TS](/exo/structural/decorator/1/index.ts)
  - [EXO2TS](/exo/structural/decorator/2/index.ts)

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Proxy Pattern
- [Proxy Pattern](/ressource/structural/proxy/index.md)
  - [EXO1TS](/exo/structural/proxy/1/index.ts)
  - [EXO2TS](/exo/structural/proxy/2/index.ts)

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
